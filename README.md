# 42_MINITALK
This is a 42 project where you should code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. 

You must create a communication program in the form of a 'client' and a 'server'.

  -The server must print its PID after his launch.
 
  -The client takes:
     ◦ The server PID.
     ◦ The string to send.
     
The client must send the string to the server, and once received it must be printed.
